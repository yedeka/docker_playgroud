1. Open run and remove the image after it has been exited.
docker run --rm prakhar1989/static-site
This does nothing but echoes the output and does not reveal any information.

2. If we run docker in detached mode so that the terminal can be closed without closing the container
We use following switches for this
docker run -d -P --name static-site prakhar1989/static-site

-d - tell docker to run in a detached window.
-P publish the open ports to random ports
--name gives the name to the newly opened container

3. use docker port static_site to display the ports of the static site container. The combined output of both the commands is as below.

PS C:\Users\yoges> docker run -d -P --name static_site prakhar1989/static-site
eb02159348990edff05c98f78e3ee53991a618ab54fa35bd0b35a458353af0ef
PS C:\Users\yoges> docker port static_site
443/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:49153
80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:49154

run http://localhost:49154/

4. docker stop static_site <container_name> to stop the detached container and still keep the docker instance alive.
