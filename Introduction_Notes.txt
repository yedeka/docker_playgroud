1. Run docker hello world
  docker run hello-world
2. Running busy box
pull busy box on the system - docker pull busybox
3. Command to see all images pulled on the system.
docker iamges
4. Run busybox
docker run busybox echo "hello from busybox to Yogesh"
5. List all running containers
docker ps
6. List all the containers that ran
docker ps -a
7. Running a container with interactiv tty
docker run -it busybox sh
Note - Even if we run rm -rf bin in the container simply typing exit and restarting the container will give us the original back.
8. To not have the disk space blocked simply use docker rm command to clean up the container after they are done.
Use the container ids to delete them.
Step1 - Execute docker ps -a to find out all the conatiners that ran.
Step2 - Execute docker rm <Space separated list of all the exited container ids from above command>.

in case of successful container deletion we get the container ids echoed back.

Instead of following 2 steps we can also do
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
q returns only numeric IDs
and f formats the output
9. Command simillar to rm
docker container prune
docker rmi
